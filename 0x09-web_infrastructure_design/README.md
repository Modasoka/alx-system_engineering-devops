# Web Infrastructure Design


## Description

This project focuses on understanding and implementing key concepts related to web infrastructure design. The primary areas covered include DNS, monitoring, web servers, network basics, load balancers, and servers. The goal is to create a well-organized and comprehensive web stack, ensuring system redundancy and addressing potential single points of failure.

## Learning Objectives


Upon completion of this project, you should be able to:

-   Draw a diagram depicting the web stack built in sysadmin/devops track projects.
-   Explain the functionality of each component in the web stack.
-   Describe system redundancy strategies.
-   Understand and use acronyms such as LAMP, SPOF, and QPS.

## Requirements


### General

-   **README.md**: Include a comprehensive [README](https://github.com/WambuaJoe/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x09-web_infrastructure_design/README.md) file at the root of the project folder.

### Task-specific

-   **Diagram**: After whiteboarding each task, capture a picture/screenshot of your diagram.
-   **Manual Review**: The project will be manually reviewed, and each completed task should be indicated.
-   **Image Hosting**: Upload screenshots to an image hosting service and include links in the answer file.
-   **GitHub Link**: Push the answer file to GitHub and insert the GitHub file link into the provided URL box.
-   **Whiteboarding**: Perform whiteboarding sessions for each task without using a computer or notes.

## Tasks

### Task 1: DNS Configuration

-   Ensure the diagram covers the web stack built in sysadmin/devops track projects.

### Task 2: Monitoring Setup

-   Read or watch the Monitoring concept page.
-   Create a diagram showing the monitoring setup for your web infrastructure.

### Task 3: Web Server Deployment

-   Read or watch the Web Server concept page.
-   Draw a diagram explaining the deployment of web servers in your infrastructure.

### Task 4: Network Basics

-   Read or watch the Network basics concept page.
-   Illustrate the network basics in your web infrastructure through a diagram.

### Task 5: Load Balancer Implementation

-   Read or watch the Load Balancer concept page.
-   Create a diagram demonstrating the implementation of load balancers in your system.

### Task 6: Server Configuration

-   Read or watch the Server concept page.
-   Draw a diagram detailing the configuration of servers within your infrastructure.

### Task 7: Final Assessment

-   Cover the following topics in your README:
    -   System redundancy
    -   Acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS
-   Insert links to your whiteboarded diagrams and [Github](https://github.com/WambuaJoe/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x09-web_infrastructure_design) repository.

## Learn More
- ``` System Redundancy ```: refers to the implementation of backup components or systems to ensure continuous operation even if one part fails. This is crucial for preventing downtime and maintaining reliability. Redundancy can be achieved through practices like having backup servers, load balancing, and failover mechanisms. In the context of this project, your system should have built-in redundancies to handle failures gracefully and ensure uninterrupted service.
- Acronyms:
    - LAMP: stands for  ``` Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Python/Perl ```. It represents a popular technology stack for building and hosting dynamic web applications.

        - Linux: The operating system.
        - Apache: The web server software.
        - MySQL: The relational database management system.
        - PHP/Python/Perl: The programming language for server-side scripting.
    - SPOF: ``` Single Point of Failure ```, refers to a component in a system that, if it fails, will bring down the entire system. To address SPOFs, it's crucial to identify and eliminate or mitigate such vulnerabilities in your infrastructure. Redundancy and failover mechanisms are commonly employed to prevent a single point of failure from impacting the entire system.
    - QPS: ``` Queries Per Second ```, is a metric used to measure the number of queries a system can handle in one second. In the context of web infrastructure, optimizing for QPS is essential for ensuring that the system can efficiently process and respond to user requests. This involves fine-tuning the system's performance, optimizing database queries, and implementing caching mechanisms to handle a specific volume of queries per second effectively.
## Conclusion


This project aims to provide a practical understanding of web infrastructure design concepts. It encourages clear documentation and effective communication of the implemented system. Follow the outlined steps, keeping the focus on meeting the requirements and showcasing your understanding of the key concepts.
