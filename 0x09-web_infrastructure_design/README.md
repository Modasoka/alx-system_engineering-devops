#<center> Web Infrastructure Design </center>


## <center> Description </center>

This project focuses on understanding and implementing key concepts related to web infrastructure design. The primary areas covered include DNS, monitoring, web servers, network basics, load balancers, and servers. The goal is to create a well-organized and comprehensive web stack, ensuring system redundancy and addressing potential single points of failure.

## <center> Learning Objectives </center>


Upon completion of this project, you should be able to:

-   Draw a diagram depicting the web stack built in sysadmin/devops track projects.
-   Explain the functionality of each component in the web stack.
-   Describe system redundancy strategies.
-   Understand and use acronyms such as LAMP, SPOF, and QPS.

## <center> Requirements </center>


### General

-   **README.md**: Include a comprehensive [README](https://github.com/WambuaJoe/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x09-web_infrastructure_design/README.md) file at the root of the project folder.

### Task-specific

-   **Diagram**: After whiteboarding each task, capture a picture/screenshot of your diagram.
-   **Manual Review**: The project will be manually reviewed, and each completed task should be indicated.
-   **Image Hosting**: Upload screenshots to an image hosting service and include links in the answer file.
-   **GitHub Link**: Push the answer file to GitHub and insert the GitHub file link into the provided URL box.
-   **Whiteboarding**: Perform whiteboarding sessions for each task without using a computer or notes.
