## Background Context

In the realm of technical interviews, questions involving APIs often surface, ranging from simple endpoint queries to more complex tasks involving recursion and data manipulation. One of the excellent APIs available for practice is the Reddit API. With its plethora of endpoints and abundant information, it serves as an ideal playground for honing your API skills. Whether you're preparing for interviews or seeking to streamline personal projects, mastering API calls can greatly enhance your problem-solving capabilities and efficiency.

## Resources

### Read or watch:

-   [Reddit API Documentation](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)
-   [Query String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to confidently explain to anyone, without the need for Google:

### General

-   How to navigate API documentation to identify relevant endpoints
-   Utilizing APIs with pagination to handle large datasets efficiently
-   Parsing JSON results obtained from API responses
-   Implementing recursive API calls to handle nested data structures
-   Sorting dictionaries by their values for effective data presentation

## Getting Started

1.  **API Documentation Exploration**: Familiarize yourself with the [Reddit API documentation](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/). Identify the endpoints relevant to your practice objectives.
    
2.  **Python Environment Setup**: Ensure you have a Python environment set up on your machine. If not, install Python from the official website.
    
3.  **Project Initialization**: Set up a new Python project directory for your Reddit API practice. Initialize a Git repository if desired.
    

## Usage

### Endpoint Querying

pythonCopy code

`# Example Python code for querying a Reddit API endpoint
import requests

# Define API endpoint
endpoint = "https://api.reddit.com/r/programming.json"

# Make GET request to the API
response = requests.get(endpoint)

# Parse JSON response
data = response.json()

# Process data as needed
print(data)` 

### Pagination Handling

pythonCopy code

`# Example Python code for handling pagination in Reddit API
def get_all_posts(subreddit, limit=100):
    posts = []
    after = None

    while True:
        params = {'limit': limit, 'after': after} if after else {'limit': limit}
        response = requests.get(f"https://api.reddit.com/r/{subreddit}.json", params=params)
        data = response.json()
        posts.extend(data['data']['children'])

        after = data['data']['after']
        if not after:
            break

    return posts` 

## Conclusion

Embark on this API practice journey with enthusiasm and curiosity. Through exploration, experimentation, and hands-on coding, you'll gain invaluable skills that will serve you well in technical interviews and real-world projects alike. Happy coding!
