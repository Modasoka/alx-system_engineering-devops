# 0x15. API 

## Background Context

In the realm of system administration, Bash scripting has long been the tool of choice for automation tasks. However, as the role of system administrators evolves into that of Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), proficiency in more robust programming languages becomes essential. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) play a pivotal role in modern system management, serving as the bridge between applications and data. This project explores the utilization of Python scripts to interact with employee data via an API, demonstrating the inadequacy of Bash scripting for such tasks.

## Resources

-   **Friends donâ€™t let friends program in shell script**: A humorous yet insightful take on the limitations of Bash scripting.
-   **What is an API?**: An introduction to the concept of APIs, their importance, and their usage.
-   **What is a REST API?**: A deeper dive into RESTful APIs, a common type of API used in web development.
-   **What are microservices?**: Understanding microservices architecture and its impact on modern software development.
-   **PEP8 Python style**: A guide to writing clean and Pythonic code according to PEP8 standards.

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Limitations of Bash Scripting

-   **Explanation**: Bash scripting, while powerful for certain tasks, has limitations when it comes to complex data manipulation, error handling, and scalability. Tasks involving extensive data processing, interaction with web services, or complex logic are better suited for more robust programming languages like Python.
-   **Example**: Fetching data from an API, parsing JSON responses, or manipulating CSV files are tasks that can quickly become cumbersome in Bash but are more efficiently handled in Python.

### 2. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)

-   **Explanation**: APIs define a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. They enable developers to access the functionality or data of another application or service without needing to understand its underlying implementation.
-   **Example**: A weather API provides developers with access to weather data, allowing them to integrate current weather information into their own applications.

### 3. RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer)

-   **Explanation**: RESTful APIs are a type of API that adhere to the principles of REST architecture. They use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources, and data is typically transferred using JSON or XML.
-   **Example**: A RESTful API for a social media platform allows users to retrieve, create, update, and delete posts using HTTP requests.

### 4. Microservices Architecture

-   **Explanation**: Microservices architecture is an approach to software development where applications are composed of small, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. Each service is responsible for a specific function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
-   **Example**: A large e-commerce platform may have microservices for user authentication, product catalog, order processing, and payment processing, each running as a separate service.

### 5. CSV (Comma-Separated Values) Format

-   **Explanation**: CSV is a simple file format used for storing tabular data in plain text. Each line in a CSV file represents a row, and columns are separated by commas (or other delimiters). It is commonly used for exchanging data between different software applications.
-   **Example**: An employee database may be exported to a CSV file containing columns for name, email, department, and salary.

### 6. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) Format

-   **Explanation**: JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is commonly used for transmitting data between a web server and a client in web applications.
-   **Example**: An API response containing information about a user's profile may be returned in JSON format, with keys like "username", "email", and "avatar_url".

### 7. Pythonic Naming Conventions

-   **Explanation**: Pythonic naming conventions refer to the standardized naming styles used in Python code to make it more readable and maintainable. This includes conventions for packages, modules, classes, variables, functions, and constants.
-   **Example**: Variables and function names should be lowercase with words separated by underscores (snake_case), while class names should be in CamelCase. Constants should be all uppercase with words separated by underscores.

Understanding these concepts is crucial for developing efficient and maintainable software solutions, especially in the context of system administration and API interaction using Python.

## Requirements

-   **Allowed editors**: vi, vim, emacs
-   **Interpreter**: Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
-   **File Endings**: All files should end with a newline character.
-   **Shebang Line**: The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
-   **Library Organization**: Import statements should be organized alphabetically.
-   **README.md**: A mandatory README.md file should be present at the project root.
-   **Code Formatting**: Code should adhere to PEP8 standards using pycodestyle.
-   **File Execution**: Files should not execute when imported (`if __name__ == "__main__":`).
-   **Error Handling**: Use `get` to access dictionary values by key to avoid exceptions.
-   **Documentation**: Modules should include documentation accessible via `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`.

## Copyright - Plagiarism

-   **Original Solutions**: Solutions must be original and meet learning objectives.
-   **No Plagiarism**: Any form of plagiarism will result in removal from the program.
-   **Content Publication**: Publishing of project content is not allowed.
