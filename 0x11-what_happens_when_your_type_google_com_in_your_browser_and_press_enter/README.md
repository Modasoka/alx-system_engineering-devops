# 0x11 - What Happens When You Type google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter

## Background Context
As a Full-Stack Software Engineer, it's essential to have a comprehensive understanding of the entire technology stack, from the frontend to the backend and everything in between. This project aims to explore the infrastructure side of the web stack, including network, servers, security, and more.

## Overview
Understanding the intricacies of what happens when you type "[https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com/)" into your browser and press Enter, is crucial for any software engineer. This classic interview question assesses a candidate's knowledge of how the web stack functions atop the internet. By delving into DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, load balancing, web servers, application servers, and databases, we gain valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of web browsing.

## Blog Post
Read our comprehensive blog post to discover the journey your browser takes when accessing Google:

1.  **DNS Request:** Your browser initiates a Domain Name System (DNS) request to translate the human-readable domain name "google.com" into an IP address.
    
2.  **TCP/IP:** A Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection is established between your browser and the Google server, utilizing the Internet Protocol (IP) for data transmission.
    
3.  **Firewall:** The request passes through any firewalls or security measures implemented by your network or the Google server to ensure secure communication.
    
4.  **HTTPS/SSL:** Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption is employed to establish a secure HTTPS connection, protecting data integrity and confidentiality.
    
5.  **Load-Balancer:** The request may be routed through a load balancer, distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers to optimize performance and reliability.
    
6.  **Web Server:** The request reaches Google's web server, which hosts the Google search engine and serves web pages to users.
    
7.  **Application Server:** Backend processes and application logic are executed on the application server, generating dynamic content and handling user requests.
    
8.  **Database:** Data retrieval and storage operations are performed on the database server, enabling access to vast amounts of indexed information.
    

## Conclusion
By dissecting the journey of a simple browser request to Google, we gain a deeper appreciation for the intricate workings of the web stack. From DNS resolution to database queries, each component plays a vital role in delivering a seamless browsing experience.
