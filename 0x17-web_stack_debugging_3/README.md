# 0x17. Web stack debugging #3

## OVERVIEW
In the realm of debugging, logs often fall short, leaving us in the dark about unexpected errors or insufficient information. Fortunately, with the skills honed at Holberton, navigating through the stack becomes second nature.

Today's debugging mission involves a Wordpress website operating within a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) stack. As Wordpress powers a significant portion of the web, familiarity with its intricacies is invaluable for any aspiring developer.

## REQUIREMENTS
**General:**

-   All files interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
-   Files should end with a new line
-   Mandatory README.md file at the project root
-   Puppet manifests must pass puppet-lint version 2.1.1 without errors
-   Puppet manifests must run without error
-   Puppet manifests must begin with a comment explaining their purpose
-   Puppet manifests files must use the .pp extension
-   Puppet v3.4 used for checking files

**Instructions:**

1.  Install puppet-lint:
    
```
   $ apt-get install -y ruby
   $ gem install puppet-lint -v 2.1.1
```
